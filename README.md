OSINT Scraper - Document Scrubbing and Instance Finder

- The purpose of this program is to take in a document to take in a document, or .txt file with copy and pasted info from a target site and find keywords and present any and all instances of keywords for Open Source Intelligence purposes.
- It's current form basically looks for words in my own resume, but functionality is being added to take in custom files by pointing it at a directory and having it look for keywords and even cat-ing out the passage that contains context for the keyword.
- The basic idea is to get both key passages and or relevant information for forming a Social Engineering plan using available information. It could be expanded to be pointed at a directory on a website and crawling the directory for creds or other goodies.

This is to be used for ethical and legal purposes either in controlled Labs and or for utility purposes. The creator of this program is not responsible for what chaos you wrought with my little tool. 

- this program had help from Google Gemini but the typing and flavour text was written by yours truly. Gemini's version of this program was much less funny, trust me.
